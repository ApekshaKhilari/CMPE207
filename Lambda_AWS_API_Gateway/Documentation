Step 1. Create a DynamoDB with a table name, "books" in our case

Step 2. Create Lambda function for CRUD calls.

Step 3. Create an AWS API Gateway for each of the CRUD calls, deploying each resource individually and linking accordingly to their respective created Lambda functions.
Please note to allow Proxy integration for Lambda function in the case of POST,PUT and DELETE call.

Step 4. The calls can be tested on a API testing platform such as Postman, make sure to pass the "id" in the request url in order to PUT/UPDATE or DELETE a particular entry.
